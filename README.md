# Free-passwords-to-Prize-tournamemts

Heyoo! With you again jescoin

 Wanna get free money ( ~~almost~~ )? I have one solution. By my script you can guess every passwords to close tournaments. Lets go!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let's take a look for [this tournament](https://lichess.org/tournament/QtrE1N4D) (Date: 28.09.24)

How we see this tournament need a password, how we need to guessed it? 

Just open _chesscs.py_ file and start it. 

That's if if you need a password from Chesscs's tournaments.

There, press the number **1** if you want to get the password, or the number **2** if you want to contact support.

After that, text the number of the TON Chess battle (*for ex. 12*)

> The password is - 1112

So what about another close tournaments?
----------------------------------------

Just open the _Another.py_ file and choose the number of password.

You will get the all combination of passwords

Good luck,
